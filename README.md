# Superstore-Sales-Performance-Analysis (Using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project was to transform raw transactional data into a strategic tool that identifies which product categories are driving growth and which shipping methods are most cost-effective.

## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/Ayush0713/Superstore-Sales-Performance-Analysis/blob/main/Superstore%20Sales%20Dashboard.pbix">Dataset</a>

## Questions KPI
- What does the Superstore generate in the overall sales volume across all regions and categories.
- How many total orders have been processed during the analyzed period.
- Is the business scaling effectively year-over-year, and by what percentage.
- How do sales and growth metrics fluctuate when comparing performance across 2015, 2016, and 2017.
- Which geographic regions (Central, East, South, West) are meeting targets.
- How do shipping choices (Standard vs. First Class) impact sales volume for different customer segments.
- What is the most common shipping method, and what percentage of the total does it represent.

  ## Process
  - I imported the dataset into Power BI and used Power Query to clean, format, and transform the raw data into a usable structure.
  - I established relationships between tables and wrote DAX formulas to calculate key metrics like Total Sales, Total Orders, and YOY Growth %.
  - I designed an interactive layout using KPI cards, bar charts, and a pie chart to compare performance across categories, segments, and shipping modes.
  - I integrated slicers for Year, Region, and Category, allowing users to filter the entire dashboard and drill down into specific business insights.

   ## Insights
  - The business has achieved an impressive 47% Year-Over-Year (YOY) growth, indicating a strong upward trend in market demand and sales effectiveness.
  - Technology is the leading category by total sales, while the Copiers sub-category is the fastest-growing niche with a 75% YOY increase, followed by Appliances at 62%.
  - The store has successfully scaled to $2M in revenue and 5K orders, maintaining a solid customer loyalty base of 793 unique customers.
 
  ## Final conclusion
  This Power BI dashboard effectively transforms raw retail data into actionable business insights by highlighting sales performance, growth trends, and logistics efficiency. It enables stakeholders to identify high-growth product niches (like Copiers at 75%), booming customer segments (notably Home Office), and data-driven opportunities to optimize the supply chain—specifically by leveraging the high demand for Standard Class shipping and the 47% Year-Over-Year expansion.
